## Overview

The **Scientific Computing with Python** course is part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. It is designed to teach Python programming through a series of interactive lessons and projects. This repository includes all the projects that are part of the course, along with detailed explanations of each solution.

## Projects

### Arithmetic Arranger

The `arithmetic_arranger.py` script arranges and optionally solves simple arithmetic problems. It takes a list of arithmetic problems and returns a neatly formatted string, optionally including the solutions.

### Budget App

The `budget.py` script defines a `Category` class that can be used to track deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between different budget categories. The class also includes a method to generate a spending chart that visually represents the percentage spent in each category.

### Polygon Area Calculator

The `polygon.py` script includes a `Rectangle` class and a `Square` class that can be used to calculate the area, perimeter, and diagonal length of these shapes. The script also allows for the visualization of these shapes with ASCII art and checks how many times one shape can fit inside another.

### Probability Calculator

The `prob_calculator.py` script contains a `Hat` class to simulate drawing balls of different colors from a hat. The `experiment` function simulates multiple experiments to calculate the probability of drawing a specific combination of balls. This is particularly useful for understanding probability through simulation.

## Installation

To use or modify the code in this repository, you'll need Python installed on your system. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scientific-computing-with-python.git
```

## Usage

Each project is self-contained within its respective script. You can run each script using Python:

```bash
python arithmetic_arranger.py
```

or

```bash
python budget.py
```

Make sure to review the comments and explanations within each script for a better understanding of how the code works.
